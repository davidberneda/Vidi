### In one minute:

* Vidi is a programming language with syntax and features mixed from Java / Javascript, C#, Delphi, C++ and other languages.
* Statically typed, object-oriented, extendable, customizable syntax.
* Very concise, using the smallest set of symbols and keywords as possible.
* Very strict, it does not allow "warnings" or "tips / hints".
* Code flow / static analysis at compile-time.

#### Future Goals:

* "Transpiling" into existing languages. Use your favourite compiler to generate libraries and executables.
* Runtime interpreter. No need to compile anything to run it.
* Small and simple IDE code editor / debugger.
* Rewrite compiler in Vidi language itself. It is currently written in FreePascal.
* Support additional platforms (Linux, Android, Apple)
* Plugin modules for user-interface and graphical applications (Forms / Views / Graphics / etc)
