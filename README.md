### In one minute:

* Vidi is a programming language with syntax and features mixed from Java / Javascript, C#, Delphi, C++ and other languages.
* Statically typed, object-oriented, extendable, customizable syntax.
* Runtime interpreter. No need to compile anything to run it.
* Very concise and strict, using the smallest set of symbols and keywords as possible.
* Code flow / static analysis at compile-time.
* Available for Windows (32 and 64 bit) and Linux 64 bit.

### Under construction:

* "Transpiling" into existing languages. Use your favourite compiler to generate libraries and executables.
* Small and simple IDE code editor, debugger, profiler.

#### Future Goals:

* Rewrite compiler in Vidi language itself. It is currently written in FreePascal.
* Support additional platforms (Android, Apple)
* Plugin modules for user-interface and graphical applications (Forms / Views / Graphics / etc)
